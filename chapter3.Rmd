32 G3 - final grade (numeric: from 0 to 20, output target


# To study the relationship between high/low alcohol consumption I choose the following variables. Mother's education, activities, weekly study time and going out with friends.

My personal hypothesis regarding my chosen variables are the following:

Mother's education, activities and weekly study time are negatively correlated with alcohol consumption i.e the higher the value of these variables are the lower alcohol consumption is.

Going out with friends is probably positively correlated with alcohol consumption.

# Let's draw some graphs, first mother's education

```{r}
# 
g2 <- ggplot(data = alc, aes(x = Medu))

# define the plot as a bar plot and draw it
g2 + geom_bar()

##cross tab

table(Medu = alc$Medu)
```



```{r}


# 
g1 <- ggplot(data=alc, aes(x=factor(Medu),y=alc_use))

# define the plot as a boxplot and draw it
g1 +  geom_boxplot()+
  geom_hline(yintercept = 2,linetype="dashed", color="blue")
  labs(y="Alcohol cons", x="Mother's education", title = "Alcohol consumption and mothers education")
```


##Based on Above graphs most of the student have mother who has at least secondary educations and less than 14% have maximum primary education. The relatioship of alcohol usage and mother's education seems to be non-existent so there is no clear pattern. My hypothesis was wrong. The average of alcohol usage is highest in the category where mother does not have any education but there is only three obs so we should not make any conclusion based on that.

## Next variable, acitivites
```{r}
# 
g3 <- ggplot(data = alc, aes(x = activities))

# define the plot as a bar plot and draw it
g3 + geom_bar()

#tabyl(alc$activities)
table(activities = alc$activities)
```


```{r}


# 
g4 <- ggplot(data=alc, aes(x=activities,y=alc_use))

# define the plot as a boxplot and draw it
g4 +  geom_boxplot()+
  geom_hline(yintercept = 2,linetype="dashed", color="blue")
  labs(y="Alcohol cons", x="activities", title = "Alcohol consumption and activities")
  
```
##It seems that activities is almost equally distributed between yes and no. There are slightly more yes answers (51%). Surprisingly, extra activities are not related to drinking, based on the graph. My hypothesis was wrong (again), damn it.

## Next one, weekly study time

```{r}
# 
g5 <- ggplot(data = alc, aes(x = studytime))

# define the plot as a bar plot and draw it
g5 + geom_bar()

#tabyl(alc$studytime)
table(studytime = alc$studytime)
```


```{r}


# 
g6 <- ggplot(data=alc, aes(x=factor(studytime),y=alc_use))

# define the plot as a boxplot and draw it
g6 +  geom_boxplot()+
  geom_hline(yintercept = 2,linetype="dashed", color="blue")
  labs(y="Alcohol cons", x="studytime", title = "Alcohol consumption and studytime")
```
Most common study time seems to be between 2-5 hours and only a small fraction studies more than ten hours in a week. Alcohol consumption decreases when study time increases, so I my hypothesis was on the right track. Vamos!

## Next one, going out with friends

```{r}
# 
g7 <- ggplot(data = alc, aes(x = goout))

# define the plot as a bar plot and draw it
g7 + geom_bar()

#tabyl(alc$goout)
table(goout = alc$goout)
```


```{r}


# 
g8 <- ggplot(data=alc, aes(x=factor(goout),y=alc_use))

# define the plot as a boxplot and draw it
g8 +  geom_boxplot()+
  geom_hline(yintercept = 2,linetype="dashed", color="blue")
  labs(y="Alcohol cons", x="goout", title = "Alcohol consumption and studytime")
```
Going out variable looks almost like a normally distributed, where three is the most common and extremes are rare (1 and 5). As guessesd, alcohol consumption increases with going out.


## Logistic regression

### Estimating the model
```{r}

model <- glm(high_use ~ Medu + activities + studytime + goout ,family=binomial,data=alc)
summary(model)
```

```{r}

# compute odds ratios (OR)
OR <- coef(model) %>% exp

# compute confidence intervals (CI)
CI <- confint(model)%>% exp

# print out the odds ratios with their confidence intervals
cbind(OR, CI)
```
The summary of the logistic regression tells me that the Mother's education, activity and study time have a negative coefficient meaning that they have negative connection with alcoholic use. The coefficient of going out is positive. My hypothesis was correct in all variables.

Looking at the odd ratios and confidence intervals, I can tell that from my chosen variables, only study time and going out are statistically significant (does not include 1). The OR ratio tells the odds that outcome happened in presence of exposure compared to odds that the outcome happened in absence of that same exposure. OR=1 means that the predictor does not have connection with the outcome, OR<1 means that odds of the outcome happening is lower compared to the reference level and if OR>1 then odds of the outcome happening is higher for the predictor compared to reference point.

Only OR>1 is going out, with odd-ratio 2.12. This means that odds of using alchol is 2.12 times higher when going out increases by one. For the other predictors OR<1, meaning that the odds for alcohol consumption are smaller when predictor increases.

### Prediction vs. actual 
```{r}
#include only predictors with statistical significance
model1 <- glm(high_use ~  studytime + goout ,family=binomial,data=alc)

# predict() the probability of high_use
alc <- mutate(alc, probability = predict(model1, type = "response"))

# use the probabilities to make a prediction of high_use
alc <- mutate(alc, prediction = probability > 0.5)

# tabulate the target variable versus the predictions
#tabyl(alc, high_use,prediction)

table(high_use = alc$high_use, prediction = alc$prediction)
```

### The total proportion of inaccurately classified individuals

```{r}
inaccurate <- nrow(alc %>% filter(high_use!=prediction))
all <- nrow(alc)

inaccurate/all
```
The proportion of inaccurately classified indidiuals is 24,5%. My model predicts the correct outcome with desent accuracy.

## Simple guessing strategy
```{r}
#include only predictors with statistical significance
model2 <- glm(high_use ~  school + sex +age ,family=binomial,data=alc)

# predict() the probability of high_use
alc <- mutate(alc, probability2 = predict(model2, type = "response"))

# use the probabilities to make a prediction of high_use
alc <- mutate(alc, prediction2 = probability2 > 0.5)

# tabulate the target variable versus the predictions
#tabyl(alc, high_use,prediction)

table(high_use = alc$high_use, prediction = alc$prediction2)
```


```{r}
inaccurate2 <- nrow(alc %>% filter(high_use!=prediction2))
all2 <- nrow(alc)

inaccurate2/all2
```

With simple guessing strategy the share of inaccurate guesses is 30%


# Bonus

```{r}

# define a loss function (average prediction error)
loss_func <- function(class, prob) {
  n_wrong <- abs(class - prob) > 0.5
  mean(n_wrong)
}

# compute the average number of wrong predictions in the (training) data


# K-fold cross-validation
library(boot)
cv <- cv.glm(data = alc, cost = loss_func, glmfit = model2, K = nrow(alc))

# average number of wrong predictions in the cross validation
cv$delta[1]

```

The model in exercise set was better. My error here is bigger.
